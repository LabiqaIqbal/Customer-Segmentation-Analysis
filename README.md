# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project involves creating a **customer segmentation dashboard** using **Power BI** to analyze customer data. The goal is to understand customer behavior and segmentation based on **age**, **gender**, **income**, and **spending score**. The dashboard allows for data-driven insights that help in identifying key customer segments for better decision-making.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer data and segment customers based on several key metrics. The visualizations include:

- **Customer Count by Age Group**: Analyzes how customers are distributed across different age groups.
- **Customer Count by Gender**: Highlights the gender distribution of customers.
- **Customer Count by Income Bracket and Preferred Category**: Shows the relationship between income and preferred product category.
- **Average Spending Score by Income Bracket**: Analyzes how spending scores vary across different income groups.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Income**: Customer's income.
- **Spending Score**: A score representing the customerâ€™s spending behavior.
- **Membership Years**: Number of years the customer has been a member.
- **Purchase Frequency**: Frequency of purchases made by the customer.
- **Preferred Category**: The product category preferred by the customer.
- **Last Purchase Amount**: Amount of the last purchase made by the customer.

### Data Transformation

Using **Power Query**, the following transformations were applied to the data:

- **Age Group**: Categorized customers into age groups (e.g., Adult, Mid Age, Senior).
- **Income Bracket**: Categorized income into groups (e.g., Low Income, Middle Income, High Income).
- **Spending Tier**: Categorized customers based on their spending score (e.g., Low Spender, Moderate Spender, High Spender).
- **Customer Tenure**: Grouped customers into segments based on how long they've been customers (e.g., Loyal, Established, New).
- **Buying Frequency**: Categorized customers based on their buying frequency (e.g., Frequent, Occasional, Rare).


## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Used for building the interactive dashboard and creating visualizations.
- **Power Query**: Used for data transformation and cleaning.
